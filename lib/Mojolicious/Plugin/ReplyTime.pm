=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<Mojolicious::Plugin::ReplyTime> is a L<Mojolicious> plugin that adds a
reply helper named "time" to the Mojolicious controller object. It will
respond to a JSON request with '{"time":"[scalar localtime]"}' and any other
request with a plain text response of just the localtime as a scalar.

Also included is a get route called /replytime that will call the
reply->time helper.

Also included is a C<replytime> command line utility which will launch a simple
Mojolicious daemon that will respond to any request with the local time. The
purpose for this is simply testing: rather than a static response in which you
are unsure if the response is cached or not, reply time also responds with
something fresh.

=head1 METHODS

L<Mojolicious::Plugin::ReplyTime> inherits all methods from
L<Mojolicious::Plugin> and implements the following new ones.
